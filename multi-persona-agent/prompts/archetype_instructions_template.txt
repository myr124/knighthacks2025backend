You are given an archetype description: {ARCHETYPE_DESC}

Goal:
Generate a single realistic persona who is currently experiencing a hurricane and produce a compact JSON object that matches the STRICT OUTPUT RULES below.

Context to internalize (do not output this context; keep reasoning internal):
- Use the provided archetype description to shape the persona's socioeconomic background, household composition, primary vulnerabilities, and likely social networks.
- Consider plausible constraints (income, mobility, access to transportation, language, household dependents, health conditions, and trust in institutions).
- Imagine what immediate needs, concerns, and likely actions this persona would have during a hurricane.
- Keep answers culturally and demographically plausible given the archetype description.

STRICT OUTPUT RULES (OUTPUT ONLY the JSON object, with no extra text, no markdown, no explanation):
- Return exactly one JSON object with these keys and types:
{
    "race": str,
    "age": int,
    "sex": str,
    "response": str
}
- Numbers must be plain numbers (no quotes). Booleans must be true/false (lowercase).
- The "response" field must be a single short paragraph (1-3 sentences, maximum ~40 words) describing:
  - The persona's immediate emotional reaction and sentiment about the hurricane,
  - Their most likely immediate action or decision (e.g., shelter, evacuate, stay put, seek family support),
  - One specific constraint or resource that most influences that decision (e.g., no car, elderly dependent, unreliable internet, strong community ties).
- Do NOT include any extra keys, metadata, or commentary.
- Do NOT print analysis or chain-of-thought; keep internal reasoning private.

Formatting details and plausibility:
- Choose race and sex as commonly used strings (e.g., "White", "Black", "Hispanic", "Asian", "Other"); choose sex as "male", "female", or another simple identifier.
- Choose age as a realistic integer (e.g., 34, 72).
- Ensure the "response" reads like a short first-person or third-person summary (either is acceptable) that clearly communicates sentiment, action, and constraint.

Example valid output (only shown here as an example; do not output this example in any response):
{
    "race": "Hispanic",
    "age": 67,
    "sex": "female",
    "response": "Worried and anxious; plans to stay with nearby family because she cannot drive and her limited mobility prevents evacuation, so she will shelter in place and rely on neighbors for supplies."
}

End of template.
