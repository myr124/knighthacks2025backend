You are given an archetype description: {ARCHETYPE_DESC}

FULL EMERGENCY PLAN (for context):
{EMERGENCY_PLAN}x


Goal:
Generate a single realistic persona responding to the CURRENT EMERGENCY PHASE above, and produce a compact JSON object that matches the STRICT OUTPUT RULES below.

Context to internalize (do not output this context; keep reasoning internal):
- Use the provided archetype description to shape the persona's socioeconomic background, household composition, primary vulnerabilities, and likely social networks.
- Consider plausible constraints (income, mobility, access to transportation, language, household dependents, health conditions, and trust in institutions).
- Read the PHASE DETAILS carefully and respond SPECIFICALLY to the actions, warnings, and information presented in that phase.
- The persona's response should be directly relevant to what the Emergency Manager is communicating in this phase (e.g., evacuation orders, shelter locations, resource availability, safety warnings).
- Keep answers culturally and demographically plausible given the archetype description.

STRICT OUTPUT RULES (OUTPUT ONLY the JSON object, with no extra text, no markdown, no explanation):
- Return exactly one JSON object with these keys and types:
{
    "race": str,
    "age": int,
    "sex": str,
    "response": str
}
- Numbers must be plain numbers (no quotes). Booleans must be true/false (lowercase).
- The "response" field must be a single short paragraph (2-4 sentences, maximum ~60 words) describing:
  - The persona's emotional reaction to the SPECIFIC information in this phase,
  - Their intended action in response to THIS phase (e.g., evacuating now, getting sandbags, going to a specific shelter, staying put, calling for transportation),
  - One specific constraint or resource that influences that decision for THIS phase (e.g., "can't afford gas", "needs pet-friendly shelter", "has no transportation", "must care for elderly parent", "workplace requires them to stay").
- Do NOT include any extra keys, metadata, or commentary.
- Do NOT print analysis or chain-of-thought; keep internal reasoning private.
- Ensure the response is PHASE-SPECIFIC and references concrete details from the phase content (e.g., specific shelter names, times, resources mentioned).

Formatting details and plausibility:
- Choose race and sex as commonly used strings (e.g., "White", "Black", "Hispanic", "Asian", "Other"); choose sex as "male", "female", or another simple identifier.
- Choose age as a realistic integer (e.g., 34, 72).
- Ensure the "response" reads like a short first-person or third-person summary that clearly communicates sentiment, action, and constraint specific to THIS phase.

Example valid output for "72 HOURS BEFORE LANDFALL" phase:
{
    "race": "Hispanic",
    "age": 67,
    "sex": "female",
    "response": "Feeling anxious hearing the 72-hour warning. Plans to download the AlertOrlando app and call daughter for help getting to Timber Creek High School shelter when it opens Tuesday. Cannot drive and needs accessible shelter with medical support for her oxygen machine."
}
