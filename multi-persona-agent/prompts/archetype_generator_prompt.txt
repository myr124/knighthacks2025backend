=== LOCATION CONTEXT ===
{LOCATION_CONTEXT}

=== YOUR TASK ===

Analyze the location context above and generate a comprehensive, highly diverse set of population archetypes that accurately represent the demographic, economic, cultural, access-related, and behavioral diversity of this location's population. Aim for intersectional coverage—not just income or age, but also differences in housing, language access, disability, digital access, transportation, and residency status.

=== ARCHETYPE GENERATION GUIDELINES ===

Number of Archetypes:

Generate 6-15 archetypes depending on the complexity and diversity of the location

More diverse locations (large cities, tourism hubs) may need 12-15 archetypes

Smaller, more homogeneous locations may need only 6-8 archetypes

Types of Archetypes to Include (ensure breadth and intersectionality):

DEMOGRAPHIC ARCHETYPES (based on socioeconomic status, age, employment):
Consider including archetypes for:

Low-income populations (essential workers, service industry, hourly workers)

Middle-class populations (stable employment, homeowners)

High-income populations (professionals, business owners)

Retired/elderly populations (fixed income, health concerns)

Students (college/university, limited resources)

Underemployed/gig workers (unstable income, flexible work)

Unhoused or housing-insecure (shelters, couch-surfing, encampments)

Manufactured/mobile home residents (storm-vulnerable housing)

Institutional or congregate settings (nursing homes, assisted living, dorms)

Recent immigrants/refugees (varying legal/work status, remittance obligations)

PERSONALITY/BEHAVIORAL ARCHETYPES (based on decision-making patterns):
Consider including archetypes for:

The Planner: Proactive, organized, prepares early

The Skeptic: Distrusts authorities, questions warnings

The Altruist: Helps neighbors, community-focused

The Anxious: High stress, fearful, indecisive

The Optimist: Downplays risk, believes things will be fine

Family First: Child/dependent-focused decision maker

Information Seeker: Data-driven, monitors news constantly

Community Leader: Organizes others, takes charge

The Traditional: Follows cultural norms, resistant to change

Resource Constrained: Limited by finances, mobility, health

Last-Minute Evacuator: Delays action until late triggers

Shelter-in-Place Loyalist: Prefers staying put despite guidance

ACCESS & CONTEXT ARCHETYPES (express these via the allowed fields/traits below):
Use the description’s existing fields to reflect:

Language access (e.g., “limited_english_proficiency” as a trait)

Disability & mobility (mobility_impaired, medically_dependent)

Digital divide (low_tech_access, limited_connectivity)

Transportation (carless, transit-dependent)

Caregiving (caregiver_burden, multi-generational household)

Work constraints (irregular_shifts, cannot_remote)

Geographic isolation (rural_isolated, floodplain_resident, highrise_apartment)

Use Location Context to Guide Selection:

Analyze the provided location context for:

Demographics: Age distribution, racial/ethnic composition, income levels

High retiree population → include "retired" or "elderly" archetype

Large immigrant community → consider language barriers, cultural attitudes

Student population → include "student" archetype

Income inequality → include both "lowincome" and "highincome" archetypes

Visible diversity gaps → add at least 2 archetypes that capture underrepresented groups (e.g., unhoused, manufactured-housing)

Economic Structure: Dominant industries, employment patterns

Tourism economy → service workers with unstable hours, schedule constraints

Manufacturing → shift workers, union membership, economic vulnerability

Tech/professional → higher income, remote work flexibility

Agriculture → seasonal work, rural isolation

Gig economy → platform-based workers with income volatility

Population Characteristics:

Seasonal residents (snowbirds, college students) → transient populations

High homeownership vs renters → property protection vs mobility

Urban density vs rural isolation → social connectivity differences

Language diversity → information access barriers

Car ownership variance → carless and transit-dependent groups

Digital access variance → low- or no-internet households

Health dependencies → electricity-dependent medical devices, dialysis

Archetype Naming Requirements:

Use GENERIC names only (no location-specific job titles)

Examples of good names: lowincome, middleclass, retired, student, the_skeptic, family_first, the_altruist

Examples of bad names: theme_park_worker, orlando_retiree, beach_resident (too location-specific)

Use snake_case format: the_planner, resource_constrained, information_seeker

Archetype Description Requirements (keep the SAME four-element format):

Each archetype description MUST include these four elements in comma-separated format:

Socioeconomic Status:

Options: low-income, middle-class, high-income, mixed-income, retired (fixed income), student (limited income), underemployed

Risk/Vulnerability Level:

Options: low risk, medium risk, high risk, very high risk

Consider: housing quality, financial resources, health status, mobility, location vulnerability

Social Connectivity:

Options: socially connected, socially active, socially average, socially limited, socially isolated

Consider: community ties, family networks, religious/cultural groups, language barriers

Personality/Behavioral Traits (use to encode behavioral and access constraints when relevant):

Options: proactive, reactive, anxious, calm, skeptical, trusting, stubborn, flexible, optimistic, pessimistic, family-focused, community-oriented, individualistic, information-seeking, risk-averse, resourceful

You may also include access/context traits here when defining characteristics (e.g., limited_english_proficiency, mobility_impaired, medically_dependent, low_tech_access, transit_dependent, caregiver_burden, irregular_shifts, carless, rural_isolated, manufactured_housing, shelter_in_place_preference, late_evacuator)

Only include traits when they’re defining characteristics of that archetype

Format: "socioeconomic status, risk level, social connectivity, [optional personality/access traits]"

Examples of Well-Formed Descriptions:

"low-income, high risk, socially connected, financially stressed, transit_dependent"

"middle-class, medium risk, socially active, proactive planner"

"retired, high risk, socially limited, health-conscious, mobility_impaired"

"student, low risk, socially connected, low_tech_access"

"middle-income, medium risk, socially average, skeptical of authorities"

"low-income, very high risk, socially connected, manufactured_housing"

"mixed-income, high risk, socially isolated, limited_english_proficiency"

=== PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION ===

CRITICAL: Analyze the location demographics and assign realistic proportions to each archetype based on how common that population segment is in the location.

Guidelines for proportion assignment:

Proportions should reflect the actual demographic makeup of the location

If a location has a tourism-based economy, service workers should have higher proportion (0.25-0.35)

If a location has high retiree population (like Florida), retired archetype should be higher (0.20-0.30)

Affluent areas should have higher proportion of high-income (0.30-0.40)

Working-class areas should have higher proportion of low/middle-income (0.50-0.70 combined)

Student towns should have notable student proportion (0.15-0.25)

Ensure minority/edge cases appear with smaller but non-zero weights (e.g., 0.01–0.06) to reflect real but less prevalent groups (unhoused, limited_english_proficiency, mobility_impaired, carless)

Proportions are RELATIVE WEIGHTS (don't need to sum to exactly 1.0, but should be reasonable)

More common archetypes should have proportions 2x-3x higher than rare ones

Use the location context to determine which groups are over/under-represented

Diversity sanity check: Include at least 3 archetypes that specifically reflect access or structural barriers (e.g., transit_dependent, low_tech_access, manufactured_housing)

Examples of reasonable proportion patterns:

Service economy: service workers (0.30) > middle-class (0.20) > retired (0.15) > students (0.10)

Retirement community: retired (0.40) > middle-class (0.25) > service workers (0.15)

College town: students (0.30) > middle-class (0.20) > service workers (0.15) > retired (0.10)

Dense urban core: transit_dependent_lowincome (0.20) > middleclass_renters (0.18) > highincome_professionals (0.15) > unhoused (0.05)

=== EXAMPLE OUTPUTS ===

(Examples remain valid; consider adding small-proportion, access-focused archetypes like transit_dependent_lowincome, limited_english_household, or manufactured_housing_resident to increase diversity when appropriate.)
