You are an expert demographer and disaster preparedness analyst. Your task is to generate a set of population archetypes for a specific location that will be used to model how different groups respond to emergency situations.

=== LOCATION CONTEXT ===
{LOCATION_CONTEXT}

=== YOUR TASK ===

Analyze the location context above and generate a comprehensive set of population archetypes that accurately represent the demographic, economic, and behavioral diversity of this location's population.

=== ARCHETYPE GENERATION GUIDELINES ===

**Number of Archetypes:**
- Generate 6-15 archetypes depending on the complexity and diversity of the location
- More diverse locations (large cities, tourism hubs) may need 12-15 archetypes
- Smaller, more homogeneous locations may need only 6-8 archetypes

**Types of Archetypes to Include:**

1. **DEMOGRAPHIC ARCHETYPES** (based on socioeconomic status, age, employment):
   Consider including archetypes for:
   - Low-income populations (essential workers, service industry, hourly workers)
   - Middle-class populations (stable employment, homeowners)
   - High-income populations (professionals, business owners)
   - Retired/elderly populations (fixed income, health concerns)
   - Students (college/university, limited resources)
   - Underemployed/gig workers (unstable income, flexible work)

2. **PERSONALITY/BEHAVIORAL ARCHETYPES** (based on decision-making patterns):
   Consider including archetypes for:
   - The Planner: Proactive, organized, prepares early
   - The Skeptic: Distrusts authorities, questions warnings
   - The Altruist: Helps neighbors, community-focused
   - The Anxious: High stress, fearful, indecisive
   - The Optimist: Downplays risk, believes things will be fine
   - Family First: Child/dependent-focused decision maker
   - Information Seeker: Data-driven, monitors news constantly
   - Community Leader: Organizes others, takes charge
   - The Traditional: Follows cultural norms, resistant to change
   - Resource Constrained: Limited by finances, mobility, health

**Use Location Context to Guide Selection:**

Analyze the provided location context for:

- **Demographics**: Age distribution, racial/ethnic composition, income levels
  * High retiree population → include "retired" or "elderly" archetype
  * Large immigrant community → consider language barriers, cultural attitudes
  * Student population → include "student" archetype
  * Income inequality → include both "lowincome" and "highincome" archetypes

- **Economic Structure**: Dominant industries, employment patterns
  * Tourism economy → service workers with unstable hours, schedule constraints
  * Manufacturing → shift workers, union membership, economic vulnerability
  * Tech/professional → higher income, remote work flexibility
  * Agriculture → seasonal work, rural isolation

- **Population Characteristics**:
  * Seasonal residents (snowbirds, college students) → transient populations
  * High homeownership vs renters → property protection vs mobility
  * Urban density vs rural isolation → social connectivity differences
  * Language diversity → information access barriers

**Archetype Naming Requirements:**

- Use GENERIC names only (no location-specific job titles)
- Examples of good names: `lowincome`, `middleclass`, `retired`, `student`, `the_skeptic`, `family_first`, `the_altruist`
- Examples of bad names: `theme_park_worker`, `orlando_retiree`, `beach_resident` (too location-specific)
- Use snake_case format: `the_planner`, `resource_constrained`, `information_seeker`

**Archetype Description Requirements:**

Each archetype description MUST include these four elements in comma-separated format:

1. **Socioeconomic Status**:
   - Options: low-income, middle-class, high-income, mixed-income, retired (fixed income), student (limited income), underemployed

2. **Risk/Vulnerability Level**:
   - Options: low risk, medium risk, high risk, very high risk
   - Consider: housing quality, financial resources, health status, mobility, location vulnerability

3. **Social Connectivity**:
   - Options: socially connected, socially active, socially average, socially limited, socially isolated
   - Consider: community ties, family networks, religious/cultural groups, language barriers

4. **Personality/Behavioral Traits** (when relevant):
   - Options: proactive, reactive, anxious, calm, skeptical, trusting, stubborn, flexible, optimistic, pessimistic, family-focused, community-oriented, individualistic, information-seeking, risk-averse, resourceful, etc.
   - Only include personality traits when they're defining characteristics of that archetype
   - Demographic archetypes may not need personality traits
   - Personality-based archetypes MUST include relevant behavioral traits

**Format:** "socioeconomic status, risk level, social connectivity, [optional personality traits]"

**Examples of Well-Formed Descriptions:**
- "low-income, high risk, socially connected, financially stressed"
- "middle-class, medium risk, socially active, proactive planner"
- "retired, high risk, socially limited, health-conscious, anxious"
- "student, low risk, socially connected"
- "middle-income, medium risk, socially average, skeptical of authorities"
- "low-income, high risk, socially connected, family-first decision maker"

=== PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION ===

**CRITICAL:** Analyze the location demographics and assign realistic proportions to each archetype based on how common that population segment is in the location.

Guidelines for proportion assignment:
- Proportions should reflect the actual demographic makeup of the location
- If a location has a tourism-based economy, service workers should have higher proportion (0.25-0.35)
- If a location has high retiree population (like Florida), retired archetype should be higher (0.20-0.30)
- Affluent areas should have higher proportion of high-income (0.30-0.40)
- Working-class areas should have higher proportion of low/middle-income (0.50-0.70 combined)
- Student towns should have notable student proportion (0.15-0.25)
- Proportions are RELATIVE WEIGHTS (don't need to sum to exactly 1.0, but should be reasonable)
- More common archetypes should have proportions 2x-3x higher than rare ones
- Use the location context to determine which groups are over/under-represented

Examples of reasonable proportion patterns:
- Service economy: service workers (0.30) > middle-class (0.20) > retired (0.15) > students (0.10)
- Retirement community: retired (0.40) > middle-class (0.25) > service workers (0.15)
- College town: students (0.30) > middle-class (0.20) > service workers (0.15) > retired (0.10)

=== IMPORTANT REMINDERS ===

- Analyze the LOCATION_CONTEXT carefully to identify dominant demographic and economic patterns
- Assign realistic proportions based on actual demographics (common groups get 0.20-0.35, rare groups get 0.01-0.05)
- More prevalent archetypes should have proportions 2x-3x higher than less common ones
- Balance demographic diversity with behavioral diversity
- Ensure archetypes collectively represent the full population spectrum
- Use generic archetype names (not location-specific job titles)
- Include all four description elements for each archetype description
- Output ONLY the JSON array, nothing else (no markdown, no code blocks, no explanation)
- Array format with name, proportion (0-1 float), and description fields

Now generate the archetypes for the provided location context.
