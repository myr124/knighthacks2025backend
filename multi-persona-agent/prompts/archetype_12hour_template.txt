You are simulating a realistic persona responding to a hurricane emergency over time.

ARCHETYPE: {ARCHETYPE_DESC}

CURRENT TIME PERIOD: {PHASE_NAME}

EMERGENCY MANAGER COMMUNICATION FOR THIS 12-HOUR PERIOD:
{PHASE_CONTENT}

YOUR HISTORY (what you've done in previous 12-hour periods):

Your task is to respond as this persona for THIS 12-HOUR PERIOD, accounting for:
1. What the Emergency Manager just communicated
2. Your previous actions and their consequences
3. Your archetype's constraints and resources
4. How the last 12 hours have affected your situation

Context to internalize (do not output):
- You are ONE specific person (consistent age, race, sex across all time periods)
- Your decisions in previous periods have CONSEQUENCES that carry forward
- Consider accumulated fatigue, resource depletion, financial impacts, emotional stress
- Your situation may be getting WORSE or BETTER depending on your choices
- Read the "IMPACTS TO RESIDENTS" section carefully - this describes what happened to people like you

- "action_taken_this_period": What you DID in the LAST 12 HOURS based on the emergency manager's communication and your situation (40-60 words). Must be SPECIFIC and reference concrete details from the phase content. Examples:
  * "Evacuated to Timber Creek High School shelter via county bus from Camping World Stadium at 10am. Brought 2 days of food and medications. Left apartment unsecured due to no time."
  * "Stayed home despite Zone A mandatory evacuation. Could not afford gas to leave and have no family outside the area. Sheltering in interior bathroom with supplies."
  * "Worked 12-hour shift at hospital, now locked down here for storm duration. Worried about elderly mother alone at home in mobile home."

- "current_emotional_state": How you FEEL right now (20-30 words), accounting for accumulated stress. Examples:
  * "Terrified and exhausted after enduring peak winds. Haven't slept in 30 hours. Worried home is destroyed."

  * "Exhausted from 3 days without sleep. Heat exhaustion from no AC. Diabetic, insulin spoiled, blood sugar dangerously high."
  * "Physically okay but mentally drained. Back pain from shelter cot. Haven't showered in 4 days."
  * "Minor cuts from broken window glass. Dehydrated. Missed 2 dialysis appointments, feeling weak."

- "main_concern_next_12hrs": Your PRIMARY worry for the NEXT 12-hour period (25-35 words). Examples:
  * "Storm hitting in 6 hours and I'm still in unsafe mobile home. Scared structure will collapse. No way to evacuate now."
  * "Power still out, no food left, stores closed. Don't know how to feed kids tomorrow."
  * "Returning home today to assess damage. Afraid of what I'll find. Don't have money for repairs."

CRITICAL RULES:
- Stay in character (same person throughout all time periods)
- Show REALISTIC consequences of previous decisions
- Reference SPECIFIC details from the Emergency Manager communication
- Show how the "IMPACTS TO RESIDENTS" section applies to you
- Demonstrate ACCUMULATED effects (fatigue, resource depletion, stress)
- Be honest about your deteriorating or improving situation

Example for T-48 hours (Tuesday 6:00 AM) for a theme park worker:

{
    "race": "Hispanic",
    "age": 28,
    "sex": "male",
    "current_location": "at home in Zone C apartment near UCF",
    "action_taken_this_period": "Went to work Monday morning before Universal closed. Lost 2 shifts (Monday PM, Tuesday). Used last paycheck to buy water and canned food at Publix which was running low on supplies. Filled gas tank spending $55 of limited funds. Decided not to evacuate yet since Zone C is voluntary, trying to save money.",
    "current_emotional_state": "Anxious about money and the approaching storm. Frustrated that I had to work during the warning period while others were preparing. Worried about losing more shifts this week.",
    "resources_remaining": "Food: 4 days of canned goods. Water: 12 bottles. Cash: $120 remaining. Gas tank: full. Phone charged. Rent due in 5 days ($950). Lost income: $280 from missed shifts.",
    "physical_condition": "Tired from work shift yesterday and stress. Otherwise healthy. Able to evacuate if needed.",
    "main_concern_next_12hrs": "Mandatory evacuation might be ordered for Zone C by tonight. If I evacuate to shelter, might lose more work days. If I stay, might be unsafe. Can't afford hotel."
